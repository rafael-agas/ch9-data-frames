# Exercise 1: creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in the first 4 games
# of the season (google "Seahawks" for the scores!)
scores <- c(9,12,27,46)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahwaks have allowed to be scored
# against them in each of the first 4 games of the season
opponentScores <- c(17,9,33,18)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe called `games`
games <- data.frame(scores, opponentScores)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points between the teams
# Hint: recall the syntax for assigning new elements (which in this case will be
# a vector) to a list!
games$diff <- games$scores - games$opponentScores

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks won the game
games$won <- games$diff > 0

# Create a vector of the opponent names corresponding to the games played
opponent <- c("GB","SF","TN","ID")

# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
games <- cbind(Row.names = opponent, games)

# View your data frame to see how it has changed!
